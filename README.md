# PHP Web Application

A dynamic web application written in PHP with an SQL backed. The web application is a mockup of a "childcare" website, where one can view services, view/add testimonials, see what kids do as part of the childcare service etc.

- Registration functionality
- Validation to prevent SQL injection
- Admins can delete testimonials
- Users can add testimonials after logging in/registering
- Public users can view the website without logging in
- Children can be registered for the service, at which point a confirmatory email will be sent to the user



Recommended way of running this:

Put project files in the *htdocs* folder of XAMPP. Set up the database by using the SQL dump file included.
